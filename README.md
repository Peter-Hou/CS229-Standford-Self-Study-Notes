# CS229-Standford-Self-Study-Notes
This repository contains code and notes for my self-study of the CS229 machine learning course at Stanford University. The repository includes implementations of machine learning algorithms from scratch, as well as code for applying these algorithms to real-world datasets. In addition, the repository contains my personal notes and reflections on the course material. Through this self-study, I aim to deepen my understanding of the fundamental principles and techniques of machine learning, and to develop my skills in applying these techniques to practical problems.
